\chapter{Introduction}


Micro-optimization is a technique to reduce the overall operation count of
floating point operations.  In a standard floating point unit, floating
point operations are fairly high level, such as ``multiply'' and ``add'';
in a micro floating point unit ($\mu$FPU), these have been broken down into
their constituent low-level floating point operations on the mantissas and
exponents of the floating point numbers.

Chapter two describes the architecture of the $\mu$FPU unit, and the
motivations for the design decisions made.

Chapter three describes the design of the compiler, as well as how the
optimizations discussed in section~\ref{ch1:opts} were implemented.

Chapter four describes the purpose of test code that was compiled, and which
statistics were gathered by running it through the simulator.  The purpose
is to measure what effect the micro-optimizations had, compared to
unoptimized code.  Possible future expansions to the project are also
discussed.
